Using pandas, I analyzed purchase information to find several factors:
-Number of unique items
-Average purchase price
-number of purchases
-total revenue
-gender demographics 
-age demographics
-top spenders
-most popular items
-most profitable items

These key points were found to be essential in determining what items hold the most weight.
